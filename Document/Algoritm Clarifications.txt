How do you Load orders in a truck considering its ROUTE?

Are there any factors on how you load a truck easily?

Does a truck really needs to be fully loaded?

Is it possible for a truck to have 2 routes at the same deployment?

What would be the decision if the total trucks available
are not enough to execute the total order stack?

In the Algorithm, how often do you have instances where drivers are
interchanged from their assigned trucks?

Does the Algorithm needs to handle the Driver assigned for each truck?


-------------------------------------
We would like to have an actual order stack sample and the
official step-by-step procedures in deploying orders 

And we would like to know the alternatives from the
problem factors experienced in the processes.
